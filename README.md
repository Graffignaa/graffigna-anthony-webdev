# Anthony Graffigna - Summer II 2017 Web Development

I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at Northeastern. 

I recently completed a six-month Co-op at United Electronics Industries in Walpole, MA.

My previous web development experience involved managing and optimizing a web based database containing results from a regression testing suite.
It was built using Django with a sqlite database.  

This repository will contain all projects and assignments for the Web Development course.
